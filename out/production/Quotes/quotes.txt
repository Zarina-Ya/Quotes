It's only terrible to have nothing to wait for. -- Erich Maria Remarque;
Life did not intend to make us perfect. Whoever is perfect belongs in a museum. -- Erich Maria Remarque;
It is very queer that the unhappiness of the world is so often brought on by small men. -- Erich Maria Remarque;
Strange how complicated we can make things just to avoid showing what we feel! -- Erich Maria Remarque;
Keep things at arm's length... If you let anything come too near you want to hold on to it. And there is nothing a man can hold on to. -- Erich Maria Remarque;
Life is a disease, brother, and death begins already at birth. Every breath, every heartbeat, is a moment of dying - a little shove toward the end.;
We have so much to say, and we shall never say it;
I wandered through the streets thinking of all the things I might have said and might have done had I been other than I was.;
He fell in October 1918, on a day that was so quiet and still on the whole front, that the army report confined itself to the single sentence:All quiet on the Western Front. He had fallen forward and lay on the earth as though sleeping.Turning him over one saw that he could not have suffered long; his face had an expression of calm, as though almost glad the end had come.;
We came to realise - first with astonishment, then bitterness, and finally with indifference - that intellect apparently wasn't the most important thing...not ideas, but the system; not freedom, but drill. We had joined up with enthusiasm and with good will; but they did everything to knock that out of us.;
I want that quiet rapture again. I want to feel the same powerful, nameless urge that I used to feel when I turned to my books. The breath of desire that then arose from the coloured backs of the books, shall fill me again, melt the heavy, dead lump of lead that lies somewhere in me and waken again the impatience of the future, the quick joy in the world of thought, it shall bring back again the lost eagerness of my youth. I sit and wait.;
Finding somewhere affordable to live in Britain is hard. Some parts of the country are cheaper than others, of course, but the cost of renting a home is horrendous, especially in London and the South. Normally, the only answer is to share a house or a flat: you get a room of your own, but you have to share the kitchen and bathroom. In cities like Oxford and Cambridge, where rooms are scarce, prices will make your eyes water: more than £500 a month. In London, they’re even higher – not far off £700.Oxford already seemed expensive when I lived there, and that was almost 40 years ago. When I started work after university, my room cost £40 a month – almost 15 per cent of my salary. With today’s rents in Oxford, you’d need to earn £40,000 a year if you didn’t want to spend more than 15 per cent on your room. But when you finish university, starting salaries are usually between £20,000 and £30,000.Apart from the cost, shared flats and houses are often in poor condition. Landlords are slow to spend their profits on repairs. I was fairly lucky with mine. The house I lived in was scruffy, but the landlord took action when needed — like the time the bathroom ceiling fell in. I’d just run a bath and had returned to my room to get something, when I heard a loud crash. I went back to find the bathtub full of wet plaster. I had the ceiling repaired and took the bill to my landlord.;
